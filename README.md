*** Featured Courses & Projects *** 
ITAI 1378 – Computer Vision: Smart Trash Sorter – Computer Vision Waste Classification System
The Smart Trash Sorter is an AI-powered classification system designed to automatically identify and sort waste into categories such as plastic, paper, metal, and organic material. This project integrates computer vision, deep learning, and real-time prediction to demonstrate how AI can support sustainability and reduce human sorting error.

*** Project Overview *** 
Using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN), the system analyzes an image of an item placed in front of a camera and predicts the correct waste category. The model was developed using a dataset of labeled waste images, with preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

*** Key Features *** 
- Image Classification: CNN model classifies waste into multiple categories
- Real-Time Detection: Integrated camera input for live sorting demonstrations
- Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes image resizing, grayscale/RGB adjustments, and noise reduction
- User Interface: Displays predicted category and confidence score
-Practical Application: Designed to support recycling centers, households, and smart-city waste systems

*** Technical Stack *** 
- Python, TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV for image capture and preprocessing
- Jupyter Notebook for model training
- NumPy, Pandas for data handling
- Matplotlib for visualization

*** Results *** 
The final model achieved strong classification performance, reliably distinguishing between waste categories in real-time tests. Data augmentation and CNN tuning (dropout layers, kernel adjustments, optimized epochs) improved validation accuracy and reduced misclassification on ambiguous items.

*** What I Learned *** 
- How to design and train a CNN for multi-class image classification
- Importance of dataset quality, preprocessing, and augmentation
- How to deploy a vision model for real-time video inference
- How AI can be used for sustainability and operational efficiency
